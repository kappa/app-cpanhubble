This is a web frontend to CPAN and Github search functions.

It does parallel searches on http://search.cpan.org and Github
and tries to merge results.

Github search is limited to Perl repositories.

We are reading data from urls that look like:
 1. http://search.cpan.org/search?query=friendfeed&mode=all&format=xml
 2. http://github.com/api/v2/xml/repos/search/(FriendFeed%20OR%20description:FriendFeed)%20AND%20language:Perl%20AND%20fork:false

BUGS:
Github search is very slow and unreliable.

XML output of search.cpan.org does not contain information about
version and display name of the author.
